## IoT: It's All about Data

The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a system of interrelated, internet-connected objects that are able to collect and transfer data over a wireless network without human intervention.

The personal or business possibilities are endless. A ‘thing’ can refer to a connected medical device, a biochip transponder (think livestock), a solar panel, a connected automobile with sensors that alert the driver to a myriad of possible issues (fuel, tire pressure, needed maintenance, and more) or any object, outfitted with sensors, that has the ability to gather and transfer data over a network.
