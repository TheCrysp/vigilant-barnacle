**Network Time Protocol** (NTP) is a protocol that helps the computers clock times to be synchronized in a network. This protocol is an application protocol that is responsible for the synchronization of hosts on a TCP/IP network. NTP was developed by David Mills in 1981 at the University of Delaware. This is required in a communication mechanism so that a seamless connection is present between the computers. 

**Features of NTP :** 
Some features of NTP are â€“

- NTP servers have access to highly precise atomic clocks and GPU clocks
- It uses Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to synchronize CPU clock time.
- Avoids even having a fraction of vulnerabilities in information exchange communication.
- Provides consistent timekeeping for file servers
