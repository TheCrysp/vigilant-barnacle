# Bus Topology

A bus topology is a topology for a Local Area Network ([LAN](http://www.telecomabc.com/l/lan.html)) in which all the nodes are connected to a single cable. The cable to which the nodes connect is called a "backbone". If the backbone is broken, the entire segment fails. Bus topologies are relatively easy to install and don't require much cabling compared to the alternatives.
