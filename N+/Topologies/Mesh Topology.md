# Mesh Topology 

In mesh, all the computers are interconnected to every other during a network. Each computer not only sends its own signals but also relays data from other computers. The nodes are connected to every other completely via a dedicated link during which information is travel from nodes to nodes and there are N(N-1)/2 links in mesh if there are N nodes. Every node features a point-to-point connection to the opposite node. The connections within the mesh are often wired or wireless.

There are two types of Mesh topologies –





1. **Fully-connected Mesh Topology**
2. **Partially-connected Mesh Topology**

**1. Full Mesh Topology :**

All the nodes within the network are connected with every other If there are n number of nodes during a network, each node will have an n-1 number of connections. A full mesh provides an excellent deal of redundancy, but because it is prohibitively expensive to implement, it’s usually reserved for network backbones.

**2. Partial Mesh Topology :**

The partial mesh is more practical as compared to the full mesh. In a partially connected mesh, all the nodes aren’t necessary to be connected with one another during a network. Peripheral networks are connected using partial mesh and work with a full-mesh backbone in tandem.

**Advantages of Mesh Topology :**

- Failure during a single device won’t break the network.
- There is no traffic problem as there is a dedicated point to point links for every computer.
- Fault identification is straightforward.
- This topology provides multiple paths to succeed in the destination and tons of redundancy.
- It provides high privacy and security.
- Data transmission is more consistent because failure doesn’t disrupt its processes.
- Adding new devices won’t disrupt data transmissions.
- This topology has robust features to beat any situation.
- A mesh doesn’t have a centralized authority.

**Disadvantages of Mesh Topology :**

- It’s costly as compared to the opposite network topologies i.e. star, bus, point to point topology.
- Installation is extremely difficult in the mesh.
- Power requirement is higher as all the nodes will need to remain active all the time and share the load.
- Complex process.
- The cost to implement mesh is above other selections.
- There is a high risk of redundant connections.
- Each node requires a further utility cost to think about.
- Maintenance needs are challenging with a mesh.
