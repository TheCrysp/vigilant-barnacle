# Star Topology

A star topology is **a topology for a Local Area Network (LAN) in which all nodes are individually connected to a central connection point**, like a hub or a switch. A star takes more cable than e.g. a bus, but the benefit is that if a cable fails, only one node will be brought down. 

**Advantages of Star Topology**

- It is very reliable – if one cable or device fails then all the others will still work
- It is high-performing as no data collisions can occur
- Less expensive because each device only need one I/O port and wishes to be connected with hub with one link.
- Easier to put in
- Robust in nature
- Easy fault detection because the link are often easily identified.
- No disruptions to the network when connecting or removing devices.
- Each device requires just one port i.e. to attach to the hub.
- If N devices are connected to every other in star, then the amount of cables required to attach them is N. So, it’s easy to line up.

**Disadvantages of Star Topology**

- Requires more cable than a linear bus .
- If the connecting network device (network switch) fails, nodes attached are disabled and can’t participate in network communication.
- More expensive than linear bus topology due to the value of the connecting devices (network switches)
- If hub goes down everything goes down, none of the devices can work without hub.
- Hub requires more resources and regular maintenance because it’s the central system of star .
- Extra hardware is required (hubs or switches) which adds to cost
- Performance is predicated on the one concentrator i.e. hub.
