# Point To Point

**Point to Point topology** is the simplest topology that connects two nodes directly together with a common link. The entire bandwidth of the common link is reserved for transmission between those two nodes. The point-to-point connections use an actual length of wire or cable to connect the two ends, but other options, such as satellite links, or microwaves are also possible.

When you change TV channels by remote, you are establishing a *point-to-point* connection between the remote control and the TVâ€™s control system.
