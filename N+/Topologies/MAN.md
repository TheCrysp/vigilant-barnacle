# MAN

A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a computer network that connects computers within a metropolitan area, which could be a single large city, multiple cities and towns, or any given large area with multiple buildings. A MAN is larger than a [local area network (LAN)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-lan/) but smaller than a [wide area network (WAN)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-wan/). MANs do not have to be in urban areas; the term "metropolitan" implies the size of the network, not the demographics of the area that it serves.
