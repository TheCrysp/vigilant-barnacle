## What Is a Hub?
A hub is the least intelligent of the three hardware devices. It serves as a connection point for the computers (and other devices such as printers) in a network. A hub simply passes along the traffic it receives to the computers connected to it. Any traffic that goes in one port comes out of the other ports. As a result, all the computers receive the traffic, even if it is not for them.

## What Is a Switch?

A switch is more intelligent than a hub. As a hub, a switch is the connection point for the computers (and other devices) in a network. However, a switch is more efficient at passing along traffic. It records the addresses of the computers connected to it in a table. When traffic comes through, the switch reads the destination address and sends that traffic to the appropriate computer rather than sending it to all the connected computers. If the destination address is not in the table, the switch sends the traffic to all the connected computers.

## **What is a** router?

Routers are specialized at **sending data between networks**. That doesn’t necessarily mean that they only work with transmissions off-site because some office networks are made up of a series of interconnected LANs. Routers are needed to power **the internet** – there are no switches involved in getting data across the internet.
